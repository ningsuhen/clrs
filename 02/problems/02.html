      <h1>Problem 2.2</h1>
<h2>Correctness of bubblesort</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Bubblesort is popular, but inefficient, sorting algorithm. It works by
repeatedly swapping adjancent elements that are out of order.</p>

<pre><code>BUBBLESORT(A)
  for i to A.length - 1
      for j = A.length downto i + 1
          if A[j] &lt; A[j - 1]
              exchange A[j] with A[j - 1]
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Let $A'$ denote the output of <em>BUBBLESORT(A)</em>. To prove that <em>BUBBLESORT</em>
is correct, we need to prove that it terminates and that</li>
</ol>

<p>$$ A'[1] \leq A'[2] \leq \cdots \leq A'[n] \tag{2.3}$$</p>

<p>where $n = A.length$. In order to show that <em>BUBBLESORT</em> actually sorts,
   what else do we need to prove?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>State precisely a loop invariant for the <strong>for</strong> loop in lines 2-4, and
prove that this loop invariant holds. Your proof should use the structure
of the loop invariant proof presented in this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the termination condition of the loop invariant proved in part (2),
state a loop invariant for the <strong>for</strong> loop in lines 1-4 that will allow
you to prove inequality (2.3). Your proof should use the structure of the
loop invariant proof presented in this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the worst-case running time of bubblesort? How does it compare to
the running time of insertion sort?</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h3>1. What else?</h3>

<p>We need to prove that $A'$ consists of the original elements in $A$, although
in (possibly) different order.</p>

<h3>2. Inner loop invariant</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>At the start of each iteration of the <strong>for</strong> loop of lines 2-4, (1) the
subarray $A[j...]$ consists of elements that were in $A[j...]$ before
entering the inner loop (possibly) in different order and (2) $A[j]$ is the
smallest of those elements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Initialization:</strong> It holds trivially, because $A[j...]$ consists of only
one element and it is the last element of $A$ when execution starts the inner
loop.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> On each step, we replace $A[j]$ with $A[j - 1]$ if it is
smaller. Because we're only adding the previous element and possibly swapping
two values (1) holds. Since $A[j-1]$ becomes the smallest of $A[j]$ and
$A[j-1]$ and the loop invariant states that $A[j]$ is the smallest one in
$A[j...]$, we know that (2) holds.</p>

<p><strong>Termination:</strong> After the loop terminates, we will get $j = i$. This implies
that $A[i]$ is the smallest element of the subarray $A[i...]$ and array
contains the original elements in some order.</p>

<h3>3. Outer loop invariant</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>At the start of each iteration, $A[1..i-1]$ consists of sorted elements, all
of which are smaller or equal to the ones in $A[i...]$.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Initialization:</strong> Initially we have the empty array, which holds trivially.</p>

<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong> The invariant of the inner loop tells us that on each
iteration, $A[i]$ becomes the smallest element of $A[i...]$ while the rest get
shuffled. This impliest that at the end of the loop:</p>

<p>$$ A[i] &lt; A[k] \text{, for } i &lt; k $$</p>

<p><strong>Termination:</strong> The loop terminates with $i = n$, where $n$ is the length of
the array. Substituting the $n$ for $i$ in the invariant, we have that the
subarray $A[1..n]$ consists of the original elements, but in sorted order.
This is the entire array, so the entire array is sorted.</p>

<h3>4. Worst-case running time?</h3>

<p>The number of comparisons is</p>

<p>$$ n - 1, n - 2, \cdots , 1 = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2} $$</p>

<p>Which is a quadratic function. The swaps are at most the same ammount, which
means that the worst-case complexity is $\Theta(n^2)$.</p>

<p>Insertion sort has the same worst-case complexity. In general, the best-case
complexity of both algorithms should be $\Theta(n)$, but this implementation
of bubble-sort has $\Theta(n^2)$ best-case complexity. That can be fixed by
returning if no swaps happened in an iteration of the outer loop.</p>

<p>Furthermore, bubble-sort should be even slower than insertion sort, because
the swaps imply a lot more assignments than what insertion sort does.</p>
